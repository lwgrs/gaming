After the Toronto Blue Jays [unceremoniously bowed out of the playoffs](https://www.si.com/mlb/bluejays/news/blue-jays-2023-season-over-wild-card-loss-twins-berrios-kikuchi) this year, I felt disillusioned. I was disappointed with their efforts in general this year and thought they wasted a year of outstanding pitching (and outstanding health when it comes to their pitching staff).

So I turned to sports video games. I wanted to play some playoff or tournament with [NHL 2004](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NHL_2004) but it turns out I must have gotten rid of this game from my Game Cube, so that was a bust. I ended up playing NHL Legacy / 16 and set up a playoff round controlling the Calgary Flames, and I recently completed that run winning the Cup after playing through adversity and coming back from being down 3-1 in two consecutive series.

With that series over I have now turned to MLB The Show 2016. I set up a new playoff round, using the teams from the 2015 playoffs – which had the Blue Jays facing off against the Texas Rangers (who [just won the 2023 World Series](https://www.mlb.com/news/5-reasons-rangers-are-legitimate-world-series-champions)). I’m not very good at The Show; because of this I don’t play it very often, and because I don’t play it often, I don’t get better.

But I won the first game of the series, lost the second, and then won an absolute laugher 8-2 on the strength of an 8-hit, 7-run inning in which I brought 12 batters to the plate. I lost the next game in a much tighter score so I have to win the next game, but the bottom line is that I’m having a lot of fun.

This is a popular baseball series for good reason, I just wish I was a little better with my at-bats. I am not a patient hitter in this game.
